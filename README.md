## The App
The Trashinator 3000 is a small app which can be used to see if any trash you find on the street is actually recycleable or not.
The main page allows for a quick, one button press identification of whatever trash you are pointing your camera at.

## The Pages
There are currently two pages for the app, the main page and an admin page.

The main page is the standard functionality which allows users to identify trash by either using their camera or uploading a picture they have taken.

The admin page can be used as a quick tool to train and export a new model for the app
